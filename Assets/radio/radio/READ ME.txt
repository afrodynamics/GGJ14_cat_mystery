created using 3ds max 2009.
rendered with Mental ray 3.6
Mental ray pro materials are used so you will need this for the metal and glass materials (otherwise replace them with your own).

Polys: 8,068
Verts: 10,108

Speaker grill material uses a duffuse and opacity map, both are tiled U=50 V=40. I also lowered the RGB offset output to -0.5 on the diffuse.
knob top map is also tiled to U=0.9 V=0.9

The aerial on this model does telescope out also, however must be in the 90degrees standing position before doing so. then just move the aerial parts
aerial, aerial2, aerial3 upwards accordingly.

All knobs, buttons, switches and handles can be rotated.
